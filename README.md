# simple_binary_search_tree

First Data Structures and Algorithms Project within TOP's Ruby Programming Unit. Building a simple binary search tree, without duplicate values. 

Three Thoughts:

- Utilized the mixin facility with a module for the first time, using the 'Comparable' module to compare Nodes against 
  each other. Very easy to implement, will try and use these more often in the future.

- Completely changed my thought process when it comes to recursion. Instead of trying to disect each individual method  
  call, I tried to view recursive methods as one big game of divide and conquer, if that makes sense. This change, along
  with the belief that the function already works while writing it, had made recursion much less intimidating for me. 
  Additionally, videos from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEEsT7DkdVO_fkrBw0OTrA on tree traversal methods helped 
  make the transition from algorithm to recursive method easier to understand.
  
- Need to start forcing myself to be a more active problem solver when writing code. Too often, I find myself taking the
  easy route, finding solutions elsewhere that I know I could've came up with myself. I don't gain anything by looking 
  up and using other people's solutions to problems. Need to be better with this.
